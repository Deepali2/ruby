$words = input.split(/\s+|\.|\,/).select { |w| !w.empty? } # This uses a Regular Expression (we'll learn about those later)

# $words is a special variable called a global variable (indicated by the $)
# It is an array of all the words in the input string and you can use it to perform this exercise
#
# For example to access the 5th word in the array do:
#
#    $words[4]
#
# Your code starts here

#prints out one word at a time from the array
# for word in $words
#   puts word
# end

# another way to print one word at a time
# $words.each do |word|
#   puts word
# end

#sorts the words and prints again
# $words.sort.each do |word|
#   puts word
# end

#sorting the words using the bang method so that the original array gets modified
# $words.sort!
# $words.each do |word|
#   puts word
# end

#sorts, reverse each word and print again
# $words.sort.each do |word|
#   puts word.reverse
# end

#add an extra word, remove the first element, resort, print
$words << 'AbraCadabra'
$words.delete_at(0)
